## Installation

Development environment requirements :

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 18.0.0
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download)

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file to quickly setup PostgreSQL and Redis in development.

Setting up the docker container:

```bash
> docker-compose up --build -d
```

Setting up your development environment on your local machine :

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/vkaelin/LeagueStats.git
> cd leaguestats/client
> npm install

# And

> cd leaguestats/server
> npm install
> cp .env.example .env # edit the values (see below for more info)
> node ace migration:run
```

### Env Values

Before running the migrations, you need to add some details to the server .env:

1. To generate the APP_KEY run `node ace generate:key`, copy and paste the value on the respective .env variable;

2. Set the database variables PG_USER, PG_PASSWORD and PG_DB_NAME. If you are using docker,
   you can set as below:

```
PG_USER=root
PG_PASSWORD=root
PG_DB_NAME=leaguestats
```

3. For the application work properly, you need a Riot API Key to set it on RIOT_API_KEY .env variable. To know more, take a look to their documentation on [this link](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
